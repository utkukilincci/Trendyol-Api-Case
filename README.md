# Spotify-Api-Automation

In this project, I try to create a dynamic api acceptance test structure

To run the test -> ``mvn clean test``

You can also run tests in parallel (TestNG) -> ``mvn clean test -Dparallel="methods"``

### Sample Cases for Spotify API

Scenario 1: 

- Get user id from Users Profile
- Create a public playlist

Scenario 2:

- Add a track to playlist which already created
